what is social anxiety? Almost everyone gets a little anxious or

embarrassed in front of other people now and then, though some of us are

more shy than others. Sometimes, though, the anxiety can be so intense

that it stops us from doing the things we enjoy, or starts interfering

in our daily lives. If this sounds familiar to you, this information

sheet can help to give you a better idea of what social anxiety is.

Social anxiety is used to describe feelings of anxiety and fear that

occur in response to social situations. Even the most confident of

people can get a little anxious before a presentation, or when they're

meeting new people, but in social anxiety this distress can be so

overwhelming that it feel's as though it's difficult to cope. Often,

that overwhelming anxiety is experienced when just thinking about the

situation or remembering a previous event. You may also have heard the

term "social phobia" used to describe these feelings. Perhaps you feel

highly anxious and distressed only in some specific situations, such as

presenting to a group of people, or perhaps you feel this anxiety across

most situations that generally involve other people. Do you feel

extremely anxious in any of the following situations? Being the center

of attention Meeting new people Talking to people in authority

Presentations or talking in front of people Parties and social

gatherings Being watched while doing something, such as signing your

name, eating, or drinking These situations commonly cause distress for

people with social anxiety, though there are certainly others. Whatever

situation you might feel anxious in, there are a number of symptoms that

you may feel in response to social situations.

Thoughts Do you worry a lot about what other people think, or worry that

you will do something embarrassing in front of others? Perhaps you

really want other people to like you, or you want to do the right thing

by others, and become really worried that you'll "mess it up". You might

focus on other people's reactions, wondering how you look or what they

are thinking about you. People with social anxiety are often very

concerned that other people will think negatively of them and are

especially worried about situations where they may be evaluated,

criticised or embarrassed.

Physical When you are in particular social situations, or thinking about

social situations, you may experience a number of physical reactions.

Perhaps you are sitting at work one day and your boss asks you to sit in

on a meeting with some new clients. Your anxiety increases and all of a

sudden, you become flustered; you start to feel warm, your breathing

becomes irregular, your heart beats faster, you feel a little

lightheaded and you have to close your eyes to try and settle yourself

down. You may recognise some of these symptoms in relation to your own

response to social situations. Heart palpitations, or racing and

pounding heart Sweating Trembling or shaking Shortness of breath or a

choking feeling Chest pain or a tightness in your chest Nausea

Lightheadedness, dizziness, or feeling faint Chills or hot flushes

Numbness or tingling sensations Blushing Dry throat and mouth

Avoidance You may have been in a few social situations where you've

wanted to hide away from everyone. As a result, you may have avoided

these types of situations for some time -- trying to escape from as many

as you can, and feeling intense distress during the situations you can't

avoid. If you can relate to these symptoms, then social anxiety might be

a problem in your life. Talk to your doctor or mental health

professional about the kinds of symptoms that you get in social

situations, and let them talk to you about what you can do to ease your

anxiety.

what can be done about

social anxiety?

If you have been affected by social anxiety, you might naturally be

wondering what you can do about it. There are a number of different

options that you may wish to consider. If you are looking for ways that

you can start reducing your anxiety in social situations, be sure to

talk to your doctor or a mental health practitioner for more information

about these and other options available to you.

Medication Medication has been used to reduce anxiety symptoms in social

situations. While there are a number of different medications that may

help to reduce anxiety symptoms, it is often difficult to know which one

will work the best. You should always speak to your doctor if you have

any queries about medication, and if your doctor prescribes them, make

sure you follow all the instructions, and report any side effects.

Cognitive-Behavioural Strategies Another option for reducing social

anxiety is to use cognitive-behavioural strategies. These strategies

involve addressing the three components that specifically contribute to

anxiety in social situations. These components include thoughts,

physical reactions and avoidance. In this way, cognitive-behavioural

strategies seek to change the anxiety habits that may have developed in

response to social situations. Physical Reactions You may have felt a

number of physical reactions in response to anxious social situations

such as rapid breathing, pounding heart, sweating, clammy palms, and

muscle

tension. To help the body restore itself to a calmer state and reduce

the physical symptoms of anxiety you can use some relaxation techniques.

Some people use yoga or meditation to help them relax. You can also use

some simple calming techniques by slowing your breathing down. You'd be

surprised how much changing our breathing can change how our bodies

respond to anxiety! Thoughts If you feel very anxious when it comes to

social situations, you may find that your thinking influences how

anxious you feel. For example, being concerned that people will think

poorly of you, focussing on negative feedback, or worrying about future

and past events, can all increase your anxiety levels. By looking at

these thoughts, or cognitions, and determining how you change unhelpful

thoughts into more helpful thoughts, you can start to reduce the anxiety

that you feel in social situations. Behaviour One of the most important

factors that needs to be addressed in social anxiety is the avoidance of

social situations. The more you don't go into these situations, the more

you'll believe that you can't go into them. That doesn't necessarily

mean that you should take on your biggest fear straight away. There are

ways to gently confront those situations one step at a time.

Social Anxiety Disorder Definition Social anxiety disorder (formerly

social phobia) is characterized by persistent fear of one or more social

or performance situations in which the person is exposed to unfamiliar

people or to possible scrutiny by others. The individual fears that he

or she will act in a way (or show anxiety symptoms) that will be

embarrassing and humiliating. Additional information about social

anxiety disorder can be found on the NIMH Health Topics page on Anxiety

Disorders.

Prevalence of Social Anxiety Disorder Among Adults Based on diagnostic

interview data from National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R),

Figure 1 shows past year prevalence of social anxiety disorder among

U.S. adults aged 18 or older.1 An estimated 7.1% of U.S. adults had

social anxiety disorder in the past year. Past year prevalence of social

anxiety disorder among adults was higher for females (8.0%) than for

males (6.1%). An estimated 12.1% of U.S. adults experience social

anxiety disorder at some time in their lives.2

Social Anxiety Disorder with Impairment Among Adults Of adults with

social anxiety disorder in the past year, degree of impairment ranged

from mild to serious, as shown in Figure 2. Impairment was determined by

scores on the Sheehan Disability Scale.3 Of adults with social anxiety

disorder in the past year, an estimated 29.9% had serious impairment,

38.8% had moderate impairment, and 31.3% had mild impairment.

Data Sources Statistical Methods and Measurement Caveats National

Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R) Diagnostic Assessment and

Population: The NCS-R is a nationally representative, face-to-face,

household survey conducted between February 2001 and April 2003 with a

response rate of 70.9%. DSM-IV mental disorders were assessed using a

modified version of the fully structured World Health Organization

Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WMH-CIDI), a fully

structured lay-administered diagnostic interview that generates both

International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, and DSM-IV

diagnoses. The DSM-IV criteria were used here. The Sheehan Disability

Scale (SDS) assessed disability in work role performance, household

maintenance, social life, and intimate relationships on a 0--10 scale.

Participants for the main interview totaled 9,282 English-speaking,

non-institutionalized, civilian respondents. The NCS-R was led by

Harvard University. Survey Non-response: In 2001-2002, non-response was

29.1% of primary respondents and 19.6% of secondary respondents. Reasons

for non-response to interviewing include: refusal to participate (7.3%

of primary, 6.3% of secondary); respondent was reluctant- too busy but

did not refuse (17.7% of primary, 11.6% of secondary); circumstantial,

such as intellectual developmental disability or overseas work

assignment (2.0% of primary, 1.7% of secondary); and household units

that were never contacted (2.0). For more information, see .

National Comorbidity Survey Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A) Diagnostic

Assessment and Population: The NCS-A was carried out under a cooperative

agreement sponsored by NIMH to meet a request from Congress to provide

national data on the prevalence and correlates of mental disorders among

U.S. youth. The NCS-A was a nationally representative, face-to-face

survey of 10,123 adolescents aged 13 to 18 years in the continental

United States. The survey was based on a dual-frame design that included

904 adolescent residents of the households that participated in the

adult U.S. National Comorbidity Survey Replication and 9,244 adolescent

students selected from a nationally representative sample of 320

schools. The survey was fielded between February 2001 and January 2004.

DSM-IV mental disorders were assessed using a modified version of the

fully structured World Health Organization Composite International

Diagnostic Interview. Survey Non-response: The overall adolescent

non-response rate was 24.4%. This is made up of non-response rates of

14.1% in the household sample, 18.2% in the un-blinded school sample,

and 77.7% in the blinded school sample. Non-response was largely due to

refusal (21.3%), which in the household and un-blinded school samples

came largely from parents rather than adolescents (72.3% and 81.0%,

respectively). The refusals in the blinded school sample, in comparison,

came almost entirely (98.1%) from parents failing to return the signed

consent postcard. For more information, see .



Begin by allowing your body to get more comfortable wherever you are.

Right now, take some full slow breaths, in through your nose and out

through your mouth. Allow any distracting thoughts to come and go as if

you're watching them floating down a stream, and guide your attention

back to your slow and easy breathing. When you're ready, breathe in and

make a tight fist with your right hand. Hold and focus on what that

tension feels like to you. Now breathe out and release all the tension

in the fist. Let your hand become nice and loose. Again, make a tight

fist with the right hand and hold it. Then let the tension and the hand

relax fully. Focus on what your hand feels like to you when it is

relaxed. Next, slowly breathe in and bring your right forearm up to your

shoulder and tighten your upper arm.

Hold.

Now breathe out and release. Again, make a muscle with your right arm.

Hold and focus on what the tension feels like in your upper arm. Now

breathe out slowly and relax your arm. Breathe in and now make a tight

fist with your left hand. Hold the tension. Exhale and release. Let the

tightness and discomfort flow all the way out of your hand. Again, make

a tight fist with your left hand and hold. Exhale and release. Breathe

in again and bring the left forearm up to your shoulder to make a

muscle. Hold and focus on the tension in your arm. Slowly breathe out

and release. Notice how that feels. Again, make a muscle with your left

arm and hold it there. Now exhale and release. Now take a long breath in

and raise your eyebrows as high as they will go. Hold, exhale and

release, letting relaxation smooth across your forehead. Breathe in

again and raise your eyebrows as high as they will go.

Hold.

Release and breathe out slowly. Next, squeeze your eyes tightly shut and

make a tight smile. Notice how that tension feels. Breathe out and

release, relaxing your eyes and cheeks. Breathe in again and squeeze

your eyes closed.

Hold.

Exhale, and release the tension. Now slowly open your mouth wide and

hold it there. Exhale and release. Notice what that feels like to you.

Again, open your mouth and hold. Release and breathe out slowly. Next,

slowly and carefully pull your head back as though you are looking up at

the ceiling.

Hold.

Exhale, and slowly return your head to whatever position is most

comfortable to you. Study what that relaxation feels like to you. Again,

breathe in and pull your head back. Slowly. Hold, exhale and slowly

release. Inhale and push your shoulders up towards your ears. Hold them

there for a moment. Exhale and release. Let all of the tightness flow

completely out of your shoulders. Now breathe in and push your shoulder

blades back, trying to almost touch them together. Hold that tension.

Now exhale, letting your shoulders and chest relax all at once. Again,

push your shoulder blades back and your chest forward.

Hold.

Release and breathe out slowly. Breathe in slowly. And now, let your

chest and stomach expand all the way, like a balloon filling with air.

Hold.

Slowly exhale, releasing all the tension from your chest and stomach.

Again, breathe in fully and let your stomach and chest push out. Exhale

and release. Next, tighten your thighs so that you're pushing yourself

up a bit out of your chair and hold. Exhale and release, taking note of

what it feels like in your upper legs. Again, tighten up your thighs and

hold. Exhale and release. Now, slowly pull the toes on your right foot

up toward your chin, stretching your calf muscle. Hold the tension.

Exhale and release. Again, pull your toes up, tightening your calf

muscle, and hold and release. And breathe out slowly, noticing what that

right foot now feels like to you. Breathe in. And now curl the toes of

the right foot downwards and hold that tension. Exhale and release.

Again, curl the toes of your right foot downwards and hold. Exhale and

release. And study what that feels like. Next, slowly pull the toes on

your left foot up toward your shin, stretching your calf muscle. Hold

the tension. Exhale and release. Again, slowly pull your toes up,

tightening your calf muscle, and hold. Exhale and release. Breathe in.

And now, curl the toes of your left foot downwards and hold.

Breathe out slowly and release. You have done a great job going through

this relaxation exercise. Continue to take some slow, easy breaths for

the next few moments. Just notice what your body feels like and enjoy

the success you've had in being able to relax your body. Keep that

feeling with you throughout the day and remember how good it can feel to

be relaxed in your body. Whenever you're ready, take some time to slowly

wiggle your muscles around a little, then count backwards from five to

one to end this exercise.

So here's the amazing thing about your brain. It's made to rewire itself

all the time. This is called neuroplasticity. Scientists used to think

that after childhood, our brain was pretty much locked in place. But now

that we have better imaging technology, we can literally see how the

brain changes depending on how we use it.

So in this video, I'm going to talk about one very simple thing you can

do to rewire your brain to be less anxious. And it is simple, but it's

not easy. So I'm also going to share three steps you can take to make it

happen and share ten extra skills that you can develop on your own or

with a therapist to build up your ability to take control of your

anxiety. And if you'd like to learn more in depth information about how

to treat your anxiety, I've got a course on Udemy that I'm working on.

It's called rewiring the anxious brain.

So you can also check out that link in the description.

So let's start off with one example of neuroplasticity. In London, the

taxi drivers have this super difficult exam where they have to prepare

by memorizing all the streets and events and locations in this huge

city. Researchers took images of their brain before they started

studying and after this two year process, and they were literally able

to see the new neural connections, the wiring that changed in the brain.

And there's good evidence that changing how you think, like going to

therapy, can actually change the structure of your brain and the types

of chemicals that it's pumping out. Our brain has an amazing ability to

rewire itself, to learn, grow and heal.

So let's talk about how to do that with anxiety. If we want to change

how our brain processes anxiety, we need to understand three principles

of anxiety. Number one, understand what is anxiety? Now, this may sound

dumb because you already know what anxiety feels like, but what you need

to do is understand your perspective on anxiety. You need to let go of

the idea that anxiety is bad.

Anxiety is not inherently bad. Anxiety is uncomfortable. Sometimes

anxiety is disordered. Sometimes anxiety gets in the way. But we all

experience anxiety because it's supposed to serve a really important

function to motivate us to avoid real danger.

We're supposed to feel anxious when standing on a cliff edge. It helps

us be safe. We're supposed to feel anxious when we know we have an

important test coming up, because that should motivate us to study.

Anxiety tells us that something is important to us. Anxiety and

excitement are basically the same chemical reaction in your body with

adrenaline, triggering that sympathetic activation and prepping you for

action.

When we look at anxiety as being uncomfortable but acceptable and a

normal part of life, suddenly we develop new tools to work with it, and

that includes working with the other type of anxiety. So the second

thing we need to understand is we need to understand disordered anxiety.

And this is when anxiety seems to take over your life. This is anxiety

that makes it hard to go to work, to school, or to enjoy life at all.

And the harder you try to make it go away, the stronger and stronger it

gets.

Now, contrary to popular belief that anxiety is disordered when it's

more severe, anxiety is actually disordered when one of two things

happened, when number one, when you feel in danger, when you're actually

safe. And I made a video on this. It's called perceived versus Actual

safety. For example, I worked with a client who was afraid of radiators.

She would feel anxious and sweaty around them, and she couldn't make

herself go into a room with a radiator in it.

Now, radiators are not actually dangerous, but she was having a real

physiological response to something that was actually safe. So anxiety

can be disordered when you have a danger response in your body, but

you're actually safe. The second way anxiety can be disordered is when

your anxiety interferes with your ability to function. This is

essentially what determines if you meet the criteria for an anxiety

disorder diagnosis when your anxiety or your attempts to avoid anxiety

stop you from effectively facing life. When this happens, you start

avoiding school or calling in sick to work.

You stop leaving the house or spending time with friends. Pretty soon,

your anxiety is taking over your life and stopping you from doing the

things you love. So let's talk about what causes anxiety to spiral out

of control. This is called the anxiety cycle. Every day throughout our

day, we have experiences, and we interpret these experiences as either

being safe or dangerous.

So let's say, for example, you see a dog. Now, each person interprets an

experience differently. For some people, this would be exciting and fun,

but for some reason, you think, that dog is going to bite me. This leads

to feelings of fear, anxiety, maybe even panic. These are uncomfortable

feelings, and you may even take them as a sign that your thoughts are

true.

So you escape, you run away, you get out of there, and nothing bad

happens. So your brain releases this surge of relief. Whew. That was

close. The only way I survived was because I ran away.

I could have died. And your brain thinks, I better do that again. I'm

going to motivate my human to avoid that situation by increasing their

anxiety about it. And voila, your anxiety goes up. Every single time

that we avoid a threat and survive, our brain thinks, let's do that

again.

So it lays down neural pathways, this wiring that reinforces that

behavior. And the whole function of emotions is to motivate us to

action. But that's a whole another video. So our brain, because we've

convinced it that the dog was a threat, it takes action into its own

hands, and it increases your anxiety level around dogs. Every time we

feel anxiety and then avoid the situation, our anxiety level will go up

a notch.

So this is principle number three. Avoidance feeds disordered anxiety.

It literally creates overwhelming anxiety. Now, there are lots of ways

to avoid. There's running away and physically avoiding, but there's also

emotional avoidance.

So if you have social anxiety, you might still go to the party, but only

if you get drunk ahead of time. Or you might be in a relationship but

scared of getting hurt. So you don't allow yourself to let the other

person into your heart. You stay emotionally distant or you protect

yourself by not committing social media. Anger, blame, distraction, and

even coping skills can be avoidant.

Regardless of the type of avoidance. It increases your anxiety, and even

worse, it shrinks down your world. So with the dog example, you might

start avoiding situations where a dog might be present by not going to

friends homes or skipping the park. And your world shrinks. You miss out

on good relationships, or you stop going to parties and your world gets

more and more constrained.

Avoidance can make your world small and scary and unhappy. But every

time you get anxious and avoid something and survive, your brain

increases your anxiety in that area. Now, looking at this cycle, we have

two places where we can intervene, where we can stop that anxiety from

spiraling out of control. The first place is with our actions when we

feel anxiety. But we're actually safe if we stick with it.

If we stay there, we experience our emotions and sensations without

running away. And again, if you do this and you don't die, then your

brain learns, phew, what a relief. I guess that not all dogs are

dangerous. Let's do that again. And it sends out a surge of relief.

This leads to a gradual decrease in anxiety over time and a gradual

increase in your emotional muscles, your ability to feel emotions and

sensations that are uncomfortable without needing to escape them all the

time. So you get better at feeling as you do this. Your brain literally

lays down new neural pathways, saying, not all dogs are dangerous, I

don't need to be anxious around dogs. And it literally changes your

brain chemistry, releasing less cortisol and adrenaline and other stress

hormones. This is the most straightforward way to rewire your brain to

have less anxiety.

But I get it, this is super hard. If it were easy, you would have

already done it. So I'm going to break it down into three big steps for

you. Now, on a side note, the second place in this cycle to intervene is

with your thoughts changing how you think about the dog. And this can be

a powerful and effective treatment, too.

But it can also get really complicated. And it works best before you're

anxious rather than during. Now, I talk about some of the ways you can

change your thinking in other videos. But in this video we're going to

talk about the most straightforward way to rewire the anxious brain, and

that's through action. So how to do it?

There are three steps. So step one, make an exposure hierarchy. I've

made an entire video about this, but basically you take one thing that

scares you and you break it down into teeny tiny steps. And you start by

courageously facing the easiest one first. Now, this is the part that

most people miss.

They jump in too fast and then they panic or they escape and they never

do it again. And then that fear is reinforced. So make an exposure

hierarchy and write down as many teeny little steps as you can think of.

Step two change your rules. Now, courage doesn't mean the absence of

fear, but choosing that something is more important than avoiding fear.

In acceptance and commitment therapy, this is called willingness.

Allowing yourself to do something even though it makes you

uncomfortable. If you make a rule for yourself like, I'm going to do

this until I get too anxious, then your brain will be like, cool, let's

do that. Then I can escape. So it will make you really anxious.

And when we say, I'm going to do this thing unless it makes me too

anxious, then we're just inviting anxiety to make all our decisions for

us. So when it comes to exposure, you choose an easier activity to start

with, and then you stay with it and you watch yourself for a certain

amount of time, or until your anxiety decreases by half during the

exposure. Now, while you're facing your anxiety and practicing

willingness, grounding activities and self regulation activities, this

body up approach to decreasing anxiety can be helpful. But the most

important part is that you sit with your anxiety for a little while

until it decreases, or at least for a certain set amount of time. Now,

step three do it, face it, go get anxious and see if you survive.

A little spoiler alert here. You will so with the dog example. Start by

repeatedly imagining yourself interacting with a dog. And you practice

this every day for ten minutes until that activity no longer makes you

very anxious. And then you might work with a friend who has a dog to set

up the next steps.

So you might see a dog through a window and you just stay there and you

sit with it and you breathe and you allow yourself to relax. And you do

this every day for ten minutes until your anxiety decreases. And then

you practice being in the same room as a tiny dog on a leash, and then

perhaps touching a tiny dog on a leash and then petting a tiny dog on a

leash. And eventually you're moving up to a bigger dog and then off a

leash. Then eventually you get yourself to the point where you can go to

a dog park, sit down and stay there for 30 minutes.

It's okay if you feel anxious. It's okay if you feel uncomfortable or

you sweat or you shake or whatever. But you just stick with it, and

pretty soon your brain learns it's cool. Most dogs are safe, you're

okay, and your anxiety will decrease. Now, again, you can do some

physiological grounding activities while in the midst of your anxiety.

But don't use those as another way to just avoid anxiety. Use those as a

way to practice willingness. This willingness to feel what you're

feeling and accept it as being normal, natural, and okay. So there's the

simple solution to anxiety. Face your fears and they will decrease.

This may seem too simple or too impossible, too big of a leap. So

therapists have devised a bunch of ways to break that leap down into a

bunch of tiny steps, a bunch of skills that you can learn to make it

easier. If you want to go more in depth into that, let's do that. Let's

talk about the more detailed process of how we do this, the specific

skills that help us move from anxiety avoidance to power over our

anxiety. Because I'm trying to cram so much information into this topic,

I've decided to split this video up into two parts.

So check out part two for the ten skills you can develop to help you

face your fears. Gradual Exposure Therapy, which is what I just

described, is a research backed approach shown to help reduce anxiety

and treat anxiety disorders. It does this because it literally changes

the brain, rewiring the neural pathways and changing the release of

chemicals in the brain. So make sure to check out my part two with those

ten skills to help you face your fears. And if you'd like to learn more

in depth information about how to treat your anxiety, I've got a course

on Udemy that I'm working on.

It's called rewiring the anxious brain. So you can also check out that

link in the description. Now, please share this video. You never know

who might benefit from it. Thanks for watching and take care.

Social Anxiety Disorder: More Than Just Shyness Are you afraid of being

judged by others? Are you self-conscious in everyday social situations?

Do you avoid meeting new people due to fear or anxiety? If you have been

feeling this way for at least 6 months and these feelings make it hard

for you to do everyday tasks---such as talking to people at work or

school---you may have social anxiety disorder. Social anxiety disorder

is an intense, persistent fear of being watched and judged by others.

This fear can affect work, school, and other daily activities. It can

even make it hard to make and keep friends. The good news is social

anxiety disorder is treatable. Learn more about the symptoms of social

anxiety disorder and how to find help.

What is social anxiety disorder? Social anxiety disorder is a common

type of anxiety disorder. A person with social anxiety disorder feels

symptoms of anxiety or fear in situations where they may be scrutinized,

evaluated, or judged by others, such as speaking in public, meeting new

people, dating, being on a job interview, answering a question in class,

or having to talk to a cashier in a store. Doing everyday things, such

as eating or drinking in front of others or using a public restroom,

also may cause anxiety or fear due to concerns about being humiliated,

judged, and rejected. The fear that people with social anxiety disorder

have in social situations is so intense that they feel it is beyond

their control. For some people, this fear may get in the way of going to

work, attending school, or doing everyday things. Other people may be

able to accomplish these activities but experience a great deal of fear

or anxiety when they do. People with social anxiety disorder may worry

about engaging in social situations for weeks before they happen.

Sometimes, they end up avoiding places or events that cause distress or

generate feelings of embarrassment. Some people with the disorder do not

have anxiety related to social interactions but have it during

performances instead. They feel symptoms of anxiety in situations such

as giving a speech, competing in a sports game, or playing a musical

instrument on stage. Social anxiety disorder usually starts during late

childhood and may resemble extreme shyness or avoidance of situations or

social interactions. It occurs more frequently in females than in males,

and this gender difference is more pronounced in adolescents and young

adults. Without treatment, social anxiety disorder can last for many

years, or even a lifetime.

What are the signs and symptoms of social anxiety disorder? When having

to perform in front of or be around others, people with social anxiety

disorder may: Blush, sweat, or tremble. Have a rapid heart rate. Feel

their "mind going blank," or feel sick to their stomach. Have a rigid

body posture, or speak with an overly soft voice. Find it difficult to

make eye contact, be around people they don't know, or talk to people in

social situations, even when they want to. Feel self-consciousness or

fear that people will judge them negatively. Avoid places where there

are other people.

What causes social anxiety disorder? Risk for social anxiety disorder

may run in families, but no one knows for sure why some family members

have it while others don't. Researchers have found that several parts of

the brain are involved in fear and anxiety and that genetics influences

how these areas function. By studying how the brain and body interact in

people with social anxiety disorder, researchers may be able to create

more targeted treatments. In addition, researchers are looking at the

ways stress and environmental factors play a role in the disorder.

How is social anxiety disorder treated? If you're concerned you may

have symptoms of social anxiety disorder, talk to a health care

provider. After discussing your history, a health care provider may

conduct a physical exam to ensure that an unrelated physical problem is

not causing your symptoms. A health care provider may refer you to a

mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or

clinical social worker. The first step to effective treatment is to get

a diagnosis, usually from a mental health professional. Social anxiety

disorder is generally treated with psychotherapy (sometimes called "talk

therapy"), medication, or both. Speak with a health care provider about

the best treatment for you.

Psychotherapy Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a research-supported

type of psychotherapy, is commonly used to treat social anxiety

disorder. CBT teaches you different ways of thinking, behaving, and

reacting to situations to help you feel less anxious and fearful. CBT

also can help you learn and practice social skills, which is very

important for treating social anxiety disorder. CBT has been well

studied and is the gold standard for psychotherapy. Exposure therapy is

a CBT method that focuses on progressively confronting the fears

underlying an anxiety disorder to help you engage in activities you have

been avoiding. Exposure therapy is sometimes used along with relaxation

exercises. CBT delivered in a group therapy format also can offer unique

benefits for social anxiety disorder. Another treatment option for

social anxiety disorder is acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). ACT

takes a different approach than CBT to negative thoughts and uses

strategies such as mindfulness and goal setting to reduce your

discomfort and anxiety. Compared to CBT, ACT is a newer form of

psychotherapy treatment, so less data are available on its

effectiveness. However, different therapies work for different types of

people, so it can be helpful to discuss what form of therapy may be

right for you with a mental health professional. For more information on

psychotherapy, visit the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)

psychotherapies webpage.

Medication Health care providers may prescribe medication to treat

social anxiety disorder. Different types of medication can be effective

in treating this disorder, including: Antidepressants, such as selective

serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine

reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) Beta-blockers Anti-anxiety medications, such

as benzodiazepines SSRI and SNRI antidepressants are commonly used to

treat depression, but they also can help treat the symptoms of social

anxiety disorder. They may take several weeks to start working.

Antidepressants may also cause side effects, such as headaches, nausea,

or difficulty sleeping. These side effects are usually not severe,

especially if the dose starts off low and is increased slowly over time.

Talk to your health care provider about any side effects that you may

experience. Beta-blockers can help control some of the physical symptoms

of social anxiety disorder, such as rapid heart rate, sweating, and

tremors. Beta-blockers are commonly the medication of choice for the

"performance anxiety" type of social anxiety disorder. Benzodiazepines,

which are anti-anxiety sedative medications, are powerful and begin

working right away to reduce anxious feelings. These medications can be

very effective in rapidly decreasing anxiety, but some people build up a

tolerance to them and need higher and higher doses to get the same

effect. Some people even become dependent on them. Therefore, a health

care provider may prescribe them only for brief periods of time if you

need them. Both psychotherapy and medication can take some time to work.

Many people try more than one medication before finding the best one for

them. A health care provider can work with you to find the best

medication, dose, and duration of treatment for you. People with social

anxiety disorder usually obtain the best results with a combination of

medication and CBT or other psychotherapies.

For basic information about these and other mental health medications,

visit NIMH's Mental Health Medications webpage. Visit the U.S. Food and

Drug Administration (FDA) website for the latest warnings, patient

medication guides, and information on newly approved medications.

Support Groups Many people with social anxiety find support groups

helpful. In a group of people who all have social anxiety disorder, you

can receive unbiased, honest feedback about how others in the group see

you. This way, you can learn that your thoughts about judgment and

rejection are not true or are distorted. You also can learn how others

with social anxiety disorder approach and overcome the fear of social

situations. Support groups are available both in person and online.

However, any advice you receive from a support group member should be

used cautiously and does not replace treatment recommendations from a

health care provider. Both psychotherapy and medication can take some

time to work. A healthy lifestyle also can help combat anxiety. Make

sure to get enough sleep and exercise, eat a healthy diet, and turn to

family and friends who you trust for support. To learn more ways to take

care of your mental health, visit NIMH's Caring for Your Mental Health

webpage.

How can I support myself and others with social anxiety disorder?

Educate Yourself A good way to help yourself or a loved one who may be

struggling with social anxiety disorder is to seek information. Research

the warning signs, learn about treatment options, and keep up to date

with current research.

Communicate If you are experiencing social anxiety disorder symptoms,

have an honest conversation about how you're feeling with someone you

trust. If you think that a friend or family member may be struggling

with social anxiety disorder, set aside a time to talk with them to

express your concern and reassure them of your support.

Know When to Seek Help If your anxiety, or the anxiety of a loved one,

starts to cause problems in everyday life---such as avoiding social

situations at school, at work, or with friends and family---it's time to

seek professional help. Talk to a health care provider about your mental

health.

Are there clinical trials studying social anxiety disorder? NIMH

supports a wide range of research, including clinical trials that look

at new ways to prevent, detect, or treat diseases and conditions

---including social anxiety disorder. Although individuals may benefit

from being part of a clinical trial, participants should be aware that

the primary purpose of a clinical trial is to gain new scientific

knowledge so that others may be better helped in the future. Researchers

at NIMH and around the country conduct clinical trials with patients and

healthy volunteers. Talk to a health care provider about clinical

trials, their benefits and risks, and whether one is right for you. For

more information, visit NIMH's clinical trials webpage.

Breathing Retraining Everyone knows that breathing is an essential part

of life, but did you know that breathing plays an essential role in

anxiety? This information sheet will briefly discuss the role of

breathing in anxiety and guide you through a simple breathing retraining

technique that uses breathing patterns to help deal with anxiety.

Breathing is a powerful determinant of physical state. When our

breathing rate becomes elevated, a number of physiological changes begin

to occur. Perhaps you've noticed this yourself when you've had a fright;

you might suddenly gasp, feel a little breathless and a little

light-headed, as well as feeling some tingling sensations around your

body. Believe it or not, the way we breathe is a major factor in

producing these and other sensations that are noticeable when we are

anxious.

Gaining control over your breathing involves both slowing your rate of

breathing and changing your breathing style. Use the following steps to

be well on your way to developing a better breathing habit. 1 2 3 4

Anxious breathing You probably already know that we breathe in to obtain

oxygen and we breathe out to expel carbon dioxide. The body naturally

maintains optimal levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide, and this balance

is in part maintained through how fast and how deeply we breathe. When

we exercise, for example, we breathe faster and more deeply in order to

replace the oxygen being used and expel the extra carbon dioxide

produced by metabolic changes. Anxiety causes an increase in our

breathing rate, as part of the physical fight or flight response to a

perceived threat. However, when our breathing rate increases without any

physical exertion, we breathe out too much carbon dioxide. If the body

cannot quickly return carbon dioxide levels to the optimal range, we

experience further symptoms such as dizziness, light-headedness,

headache, weakness and tingling in the extremities and muscle stiffness.

The normal rate of breathing is 10-14 breaths per minute -- what's your

breathing rate?

Breathing Retraining While temporary overbreathing and hyperventilation

are not specifically dangerous (it's even used in medical testing!),

continued overbreathing can leave you feeling exhausted or "on edge" so

that you're more likely to respond to stressful situations with intense

anxiety and panic.

5

Ensure that you are sitting on a comfortable chair or laying on a bed

Take a breath in for 4 seconds (through the nose if possible Hold the

breath for 2 seconds Release the breath taking 6 seconds (through the

nose if possible)., then pause slightly before breathing in again.

Practise, practise, practise!

Breathing tips ·

When you first begin changing your breathing, it may be difficult to

slow your breathing down to this rate. You may wish to try using a 3-in,

1hold, 4-out breathing rate to start off with.

·

When you are doing your breathing exercises, make sure that you are

using a stomach breathing style rather than a chest breathing style. You

can check this by placing one hand on your stomach and one hand on your

chest. The hand on your stomach should rise when you breathe in.

·

Try to practise at least once or twice a day at a time when you can

relax, relatively free from distraction. This will help to develop a

more relaxed breathing habit. The key to progress really is practise, so

try to set aside some time each day.

By using breathing retraining you can slow your breathing down and

reduce your general level anxiety. With enough practice, it can even

help to better cope with anxiety when you are in an anxious situation.

progressive muscle

relaxation

One of the body's reactions to fear and anxiety is muscle tension. This

can result in feeling "tense", or can lead to muscle aches and pains, as

well as leaving some people feeling exhausted. Think about how you

respond to anxiety. Do you "tense up" when you're feeling anxious?

Muscle relaxation can be particularly helpful in cases where anxiety is

especially associated to muscle tension. This information sheet will

guide you through a common form of relaxation designed to reduce muscle

tension.

Muscle tension

Relaxation sequence

Muscle tension is commonly associated with stress, anxiety and fear as

part of a process that helps our bodies prepare for potentially

dangerous situations. Even though some of those situations may not

actually be dangerous, our bodies respond in the same way. Sometimes we

don't even notice how our muscles become tense, but perhaps you clench

your teeth slightly so your jaw feels tight, or maybe your shoulders

become. Muscle tension can also be associated with backaches and tension

headaches.

Progressive Muscle Relaxation One method of reducing muscle tension that

people have found helpful is through a technique called Progressive

Muscle Relaxation (PMR). In progressive muscle relaxation exercises, you

tense up particular muscles and then relax them, and then you practise

this technique consistently.











preparing for relaxation



When you are beginning to practice progressive muscle relaxation

exercises keep in mind the folloing points.



- Physical injuries. If you have any injuries, or a history of physical

problems that may cause muscle pain, always consult your doctor before

you start. • Select your surroundings. Minimise the distraction to your

five senses. Such as turning off the TV and radio, and using soft

lighting. • Make yourself comfortable. Use a chair that comfortably

seats your body, including your head. Wear loose clothing, and take off

your shoes. • Internal mechanics. Avoid practicing after big, heavy

meals, and do not practice after consuming any intoxicants, such as

alcohol.

Right hand and forearm. Make a fist with your right hand. Right upper

arm. Bring your right forearm up to your shoulder to "make a muscle".

Left hand and forearm. Left upper arm. Forehead. Raise your eyebrows as

high as they will go, as though you were surprised by something. Eyes

and cheeks. Squeeze your eyes tight shut. Mouth and jaw. Open your mouth

as wide as you can, as you might when you're yawning. Neck. !!! Be

careful as you tense these muscles. Face forward and then pull your head

back slowly, as though you are looking up to the ceiling. Shoulders.

Tense the muscles in your shoulders as you bring your shoulders up

towards your ears. Shoulder blades/Back. Push your shoulder blades back,

trying to almost touch them together, so that your chest is pushed

forward. Chest and stomach. Breathe in deeply, filling up your lungs and

chest with air. Hips and buttocks. Squeeze your buttock muscles Right

upper leg. Tighten your right thigh. Right lower leg. !!! Do this slowly

and carefully to avoid cramps. Pull your toes towards you to stretch the

calf muscle. Right foot. Curl your toes downwards. Left upper leg.

Repeat as for right upper leg. Left lower leg. Repeat as for right lower

leg. Left foot. Repeat as for right foot.

general procedure 1 Once you've set aside the time and place for

relaxation, slow down your breathing and give yourself permission to

relax. 2 When you are ready to begin, tense the muscle group described.

Make sure you can feel the tension, but not so much that you feel a

great deal of pain. Keep the muscle tensed for approximately 5 seconds.

3 Relax the muscles and keep it relaxed for approximately 10 seconds. It

may be helpful to say something like "Relax" as you relax the muscle. 4

When you have finished the relaxation procedure, remain seated for a few

moments allowing yourself to become alert.

Practice means progress. Only through practice can you become more aware

of your muscles, how they respond with tension, and how you can relax

them. Training your body to respond differently to stress is like any

training -- practising consistently is the key.
